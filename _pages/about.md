I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering](https://imse.statler.wvu.edu/) at West Virginia University, working with [Prof. Nasrabadi](https://nassernasrabadi.faculty.wvu.edu/). I am interested in deep learning, machine learning (ML), mathematics, pattern recognition, and computer vision. Currently, I am studying adversarial ML, network compression, interpretable ML, and unsupervised representation learning. I am also working on applications of deep learning in computer vision and biometrics.
