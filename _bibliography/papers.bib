  abstract = {Background: The role of socioeconomic status (SES) of patients in health care outcomes has been investigated in many health
                            care systems. The health care literature suggests that there is a relationship between patients' socioeconomic status and their
                            health care outcomes. Most research has investigated this relation using individual SES, rather than exploring the regional
                            socioeconomic characteristics ofa population on patients' outcomes.
                            Purpose: This study explores the correlation between regional socioeconomic characteristics of a population and patients' hospital length
                            of stay (LOS). Assuming the demographic characteristics of patients in a region are relatively consistent, this will enable more effective
                            regional planning and a customized decision-making process considering characteristics of the population that a health care system serves.
                            Methodology: We use a weighted clustering algorithm to exploit the relationship between regional socioeconomic characteristics and
                            patients' LOS. To do so, the demographic attributes and regional socioeconomic factors of patients are obtained using their ZIP Codes.
                            Results: The results suggest that regional characteristics have a direct impact on LOS, and patients of the same medical status may
                            experience longer LOS if they live in a more disadvantaged community.
                            Practice implications: Our findings indicate that regional demographic characteristics of the population a health care system
                            serves can have an impact on surgical patient outcomes, specifically length of stay, and therefore can be considered by hospital
                            administrators to enable more efficient and effective resource and operational planning. In optimizing care delivery, to achieve
                            the best possible value for individual patients and populations, it is imp01tant to understand all factors that contribute to the
                            outcomes in order to focus resources to mitigate those that reduce value.},

  abstract = {Patient length of stay (LOS) is commonly used as an important factor for optimizing medical resource consumption, managing hospital expenses, and improving the quality of hospital services. An accurate prediction of LOS can lead to increased hospital efficiency. In this study, we identify the most significant features for predicting LOS of patients undergoing different surgical procedures. We incorporate a non-linear feature selection method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and develop a predictive model for accurate prediction of LOS using the selected features. The performance of the model on different patient categories indicates that the non-linear feature selection method can effectively reduce the number of features and improve the accuracy of the prediction.},
