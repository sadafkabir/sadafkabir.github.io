  abstract = {Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial manipulations in the input domain. The extent of vulnerability has been explored intensively in cases of l_p-bounded and l_p-minimal adversarial perturbations. However, the vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial perturbations with specific statistical properties or frequency-domain characteristics has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we study the smoothness of perturbations and propose SmoothFool, a general and computationally efficient framework for computing smooth adversarial perturbations. Through extensive experiments, we validate the efficacy of the proposed method for both the white-box and black-box attack scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate that: (i) there exist extremely smooth adversarial perturbations for well-established and widely used network architectures, (ii) smoothness significantly enhances the robustness of perturbations against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, (iii) smoothness improves the transferability of adversarial perturbations across both data points and network architectures, and (iv) class categories exhibit a variable range of susceptibility to smooth perturbations. Our results suggest that smooth APs can play a significant role in exploring the vulnerability extent of DNNs to adversarial examples..},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a framework for disentangling the appearance and geometry representations in the face recognition task. To provide supervision for this aim, we generate geometrically identical faces by incorporating spatial transformations. We demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances the performance of deep face recognition models by assisting the training process in two ways. First, it enforces the early and intermediate convolutional layers to learn more representative features that satisfy the properties of disentangled embeddings. Second, it augments the training set by altering faces geometrically. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that integrating the proposed approach into state-of-the-art face recognition methods effectively improves their performance on challenging datasets, such as LFW, YTF, and MegaFace. Both theoretical and practical aspects of the method are analyzed rigorously by concerning ablation studies and knowledge transfer tasks. Furthermore, we show that the knowledge leaned by the proposed method can favor other face-related tasks, such as attribute prediction.},

  abstract = {Developing accurate predictive models can profoundly help
              healthcare providers improve the quality of their services. However, medical
              data often contain several variables, and not all the data equally contribute
              towards the prediction. The existence of irrelevant and redundant features in a
              dataset can unnecessarily increase computational cost and complexity while
              deteriorating the performance of the predictive model. In this study, we employ
              the gradient-based prediction attribution as a general tool to identify important
              features in differentiable predictive models, such as neural networks (NN) and
              linear regression. Built upon this approach, we analyse single-stage and
              multi-stage scenarios for feature selection using ten medical datasets. Through
              extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the combination of the
              gradient-based approach with NN provides a powerful nonlinear technique to
              identify important features contributing to the prediction. In particular,
              nonlinear gradient-based feature selection achieves competitive results or
              significant improvements over previously reported results on all dataset.},

  abstract = {Background: The role of socioeconomic status (SES) of patients in health care outcomes has been investigated in many health
              care systems. The health care literature suggests that there is a relationship between patients' socioeconomic status and their
              health care outcomes. Most research has investigated this relation using individual SES, rather than exploring the regional
              socioeconomic characteristics ofa population on patients' outcomes.
              Purpose: This study explores the correlation between regional socioeconomic characteristics of a population and patients' hospital length
              of stay (LOS). Assuming the demographic characteristics of patients in a region are relatively consistent, this will enable more effective
              regional planning and a customized decision-making process considering characteristics of the population that a health care system serves.
              Methodology: We use a weighted clustering algorithm to exploit the relationship between regional socioeconomic characteristics and
              patients' LOS. To do so, the demographic attributes and regional socioeconomic factors of patients are obtained using their ZIP Codes.
              Results The results suggest that regional characteristics have a direct impact on LOS, and patients of the same medical status may
              experience longer LOS if they live in a more disadvantaged community.
              Practice implications: Our findings indicate that regional demographic characteristics of the population a health care system
              serves can have an impact on surgical patient outcomes, specifically length of stay, and therefore can be considered by hospital
              administrators to enable more efficient and effective resource and operational planning. In optimizing care delivery, to achieve
              the best possible value for individual patients and populations, it is imp01tant to understand all factors that contribute to the
              outcomes in order to focus resources to mitigate those that reduce value.},

  abstract = {Patient length of stay (LOS) is commonly used as an important factor for optimizing medical resource consumption, managing hospital expenses, and improving the quality of hospital services. An accurate prediction of LOS can lead to increased hospital efficiency. In this study, we identify the most significant features for predicting LOS of patients undergoing different surgical procedures. We incorporate a non-linear feature selection method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and develop a predictive model for accurate prediction of LOS using the selected features. The performance of the model on different patient categories indicates that the non-linear feature selection method can effectively reduce the number of features and improve the accuracy of the prediction.},
